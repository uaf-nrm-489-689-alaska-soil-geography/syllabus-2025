# Introduction

You are about to embark on one of the most memorable field experiences of your life, with tremendous learning potential, new colleagues and friends, and adventure literally around every corner. The originator of this course was Prof. Chien Lu Ping; he and Gary Michaelson took hundreds of students on this course over 30 years starting in 1985. Since Dr. Ping retired in 2015, instruction of the course has been maintained by a collaborative group of instructors.

Students enrolling in this course come from many different backgrounds and specialties Naturally, there will be wide variability in field experience, background, and familiarity with soil science and arctic environments. Throughout the course please know that we all work to learn and experience together. The diversity of this class is one of its greatest strengths. 

*We gratefully acknowledge the Native Peoples on whose ancestral homelands we gather, as well as the diverse and vibrant Native communities who make their home in AK today, and commit to following Woodwell Climateâ€™s guiding principles for working in local northern communities.*

## Course Goals

During this unforgettable 2-weeks and ~1000 kilometers long trip students can
see profiles of 6 soil orders: Gelisols (Histels, Turbels and Orthels), Inceptisols,
Spodosols, Andisols, Mollisols and Entisols; different vegetation communities
including deciduous and coniferous boreal forest, tundra and grassland as well as
different permafrost related landforms such as polygons, pingo, palsas,
solifluction, stone circles and, of course, glaciers.

- Discuss permafrost properties, occurrence, and degradation in the wake of
climate change.

- Relate the chemical, physical, biogeochemical and morphological characteristics
of soils to their occurrence, behavior, and classification.

- Describe hydric soils and identify common wetland indicator plants and
hydrology features in the field.

- Relate soils to hydrology, climate, parent materials, age, chemistry, ecology,and
anthropogenic disturbances across the interior of Alaska.

## Catalog Description and Course Description

Soil geography along an ecological transect in selected areas of Alaska. Hands-on experiences with soil morphology and exploration of the relationships between soil genesis and other ecological factors including vegetation, geology, landform, climate and hydrology. Includes discussion of soil classification and land use interpretations. Students must provide their own camp gear, be able to walk on uneven or rocky ground and be physically fit for field work.

Comprehension of the major factors governing the properties and behavior of soils, and the associated climate, hydrology and ecology on a transect between Anchorage and Deadhorse, AK is essential to understanding the soil classification and permafrost dynamics associated with environmental change.

The class is a mix of lectures, fieldworks, practical sessions, and special events.
Hands-on activities include soil description and classification, vegetation
characterization as well as coring and sampling of frozen soils.
