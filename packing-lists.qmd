# What to Expect and Packing Lists

## What to Expect!

- The weather will vary dramatically. We will plan to work through the rain and cold, so dress accordingly.

- Wildlife. Bears are prevalent in many parts of Alaska. We will observe wildlife safety practices and also will be traveling in a group at all times so any unexpected encounters will be unlikely.

- North of Fairbanks, there will be no electricity and limited cell phone reception for several days.

- Mosquitos may be extremely thick at times. All students are strongly encouraged to
bring repellant and a bug net to wear over your head. More information in packing list.

- When we are camping, everyone will need to pitch in to help cook and clean. **We will do everything in our power to accomodate dietary preferences/needs**. Breakfast generally consists of quick oats, eggs, bacon, coffee, fruit, etc. Lunches are mostly cold cut sandwiches, chips, fruit, etc. Dinners will be something easy to prepare in camp; typically spaghetti, nachos, tuna casserole, hamburgers, etc. We eat wellâ€“ do not worry.

## Packing List and Equipment

Because we will be camping for several nights throughout the trip, you must have a tent (with full rain fly - see below), a sleeping mat, and a sleeping bag. We will be in the field each day regardless of weather, temperature or precipitation. It is critical that you are prepared for a wide range of weather conditions. Temperatures can range widely in July in northern Alaska, from 30 degrees to > 80 degrees. Layers are critical, and options are important. Rubber knee boots (brands such as Xtra-Tuff or LaCrosse) are also an excellent choice of footwear for our fieldwork in the interior and north. Good rain gear (top and bottom, with taped seams) is also a necessity. An emergency poncho also takes up a small amount of space but can be a good layer in heavy rain. 

### Tents

Everybody will need a tent. Because we will not be able to pack up in the event of inclement weather, all tents should have a **full rain fly**. Many off the shelf tents do not come with a full rain fly, and instead have no rain fly or a partial rain fly.

### Boots and Rain Gear

This is a field course and students will be expected to have the gear that will allow them to conduct field activities. Please review in detail the packing list below. Rubber boots and rain gear are two very key components of the field gear that you will need. 

#### Rubber Boots 

Ensure your rubber boots are calf or knee high (not ankle height) rubber boots. Two excellent brands are XtraTuf and LaCrosse - below are just some suggestions (of course you are free to bring any brand of rubber boots that you feel will also be adequate) - note that these suggestions are all boots that are at least 14-18" tall. You will want rubber boots that are in this height range.

    - [14" Grange Women's](https://www.lacrossefootwear.com/women/outdoor/women-s-grange-14-black-tan.html)
    
#### Rain Gear

There are many different types of rain gear ranging from heavy duty fishing style rain gear to shell-type thin rain gear - you should ensure that the rain gear you bring for this course is waterproof (not just water resistant) and has, at a minimum, taped inner seams. Many of the "semi-waterproof, semi-breathable" styles of light rain gear do NOT have taped inner seams. They will let water in in a heavy rain or in constant all day rain. In order to ensure your comfort throughout the course, please ensure you select rain gear that is well suited to all day rain conditions, which we may encounter. REI has a fairly comprehensive [rain jacket selection guide](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/rainwear.html). Nearly all fishing style rain gear (i.e. Helly Hansen, Grundens, Simms) will be waterproof and appropriate for the course, but many other types of rain gear will be just fine provided they are truly waterproof.

Please ensure you have both a waterproof wet weather top (i.e. rain jacket) AND waterproof wet weather bottoms. The bottoms could be rain pants or bibs (suspender style rain pants).

### Individual Packing List

This is a minimum packing list - you are free to bring anything else you feel that you need.

colnames(packing.list) = c("Item", "Quantity", "Notes")

# Create the table
kbl(packing.list, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling("bordered", full_width = F, fixed_thead = T, html_font = "arial") %>%
