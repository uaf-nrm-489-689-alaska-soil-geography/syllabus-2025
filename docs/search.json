    "text": "Course Format\nThe class will begin with some introductory soil science and ecology lectures, introduction to arctic soil processes, Alaska in general, and a discussion of what we are likely to encounter throughout the course. Fieldwork will begin gradually, gaining in complexity and intensity with movement north; especially north of Fairbanks. Throughout the course, we will be camping many nights with a few nights of “civilization” in Fairbanks that will let you rest a bit more comfortably, launder some clothes, and prepare for more time in the field. Once we leave Fairbanks, there will be very little in the way of provisions, so please come prepared with all needed gear. If you have ANY questions, kindly contact one of the instructors for guidance.",

    "text": "1.1 Course Goals\nDuring this unforgettable 2-weeks and ~1000 kilometers long trip students can see profiles of 6 soil orders: Gelisols (Histels, Turbels and Orthels), Inceptisols, Spodosols, Andisols, Mollisols and Entisols; different vegetation communities including deciduous and coniferous boreal forest, tundra and grassland as well as different permafrost related landforms such as polygons, pingo, palsas, solifluction, stone circles and, of course, glaciers.\nThe first priority for this course is to bring students closer to the excitement and surprises that come from experiencing the Arctic up close. In the early days of Ecology, much of a student’s experience was outdoors — learning plant names, observing wildlife, and being introduced to basic ecological principles. Today, the tools for doing ecological research have greatly expanded, and students’ course work and time are increasingly spent indoors learning the latest genomic, laboratory analyses, GIS, remote-sensing, statistical-analysis, and modeling tools. Surprisingly, this is especially true for the Arctic, which is remote and difficult to travel to during most of the year. Field work is generally limited to the summer months. The focus in this course is an in-depth field experience across a wide range of disciplines and environments. Students will experience an amazing 500-km ecological transect through the U.S. arctic and boreal forest biomes. They will draw on the long experience of several instructors who have all spent their careers studying these systems. The goal is to achieve an in-depth understanding of arctic ecosystems, and their interactions with climate and human-related changes.\nThe course has a geo-ecological focus with strong grounding in geology, soils, and permafrost conditions. Permafrost has a special importance, and students will see the many manifestations of permafrost that occur in cold-climate ecosystems, including a wide-variety of unique periglacial landforms, such as ice-wedge polygon, frozen debris lobes, rock glaciers, frost-boils, pingos, and river icings (aufeis). Students will collect permafrost cores to understand how ice gets into the soils, how it degrades, why it is so sensitive to climate change, a hazard for infrastructure, and how it contributes to increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. They will see how degrading permafrost is affecting boreal and arctic ecosystems, and experience ancient buried permafrost in the U.S. Army Cold Regions Research Laboratory’s Permafrost Tunnel — complete with Pleistocene mammal remains.\nAnother major focus is recognition of plants, including the mosses and lichens, because vegetation is the key to understanding many aspects of Arctic ecosystems. Students will keep field books with drawing for various aspects of ecosystems (toposequences, chronosequences, and plant drawings). Although there is considerable emphasis on plant taxonomy and plant communities, we try not to weigh students down with worries about memorizing names. They should recognize as many plants with their Latin names as possible in the short time that we have in the field, but also learn how to find the names when they need to know them, how to recognize and describe plant communities, and most importantly realize the relevance of vegetation to many aspects of Arctic systems. We will also pay special attention to birds and insects and their relationship to the many arctic habitats that we will encounter.",

We will observe wildlife safety practices and also will be traveling in a group at all times so any unexpected encounters will be unlikely.\nNorth of Fairbanks, there will be no electricity and limited cell phone reception for several days.\nMosquitos may be extremely thick at times. All students are strongly encouraged to bring repellant and a bug net to wear over your head. More information in packing list.\nWhen we are camping, everyone will need to pitch in to help cook and clean. We will do everything in our power to accomodate dietary preferences/needs. Breakfast generally consists of quick oats, eggs, bacon, coffee, fruit, etc. Lunches are mostly cold cut sandwiches, chips, fruit, etc. Dinners will be something easy to prepare in camp; typically spaghetti, nachos, tuna casserole, hamburgers, etc. We eat well– do not worry.",

    "section": "4.2 Packing List and Equipment",
    "text": "4.2 Packing List and Equipment\nBecause we will be camping for several nights throughout the trip, you must have a tent (with full rain fly - see below), a sleeping mat, and a sleeping bag. We will be in the field each day regardless of weather, temperature or precipitation. It is critical that you are prepared for a wide range of weather conditions. Temperatures can range widely in July in northern Alaska, from 30 degrees to &gt; 80 degrees. Layers are critical, and options are important. Rubber knee boots (brands such as Xtra-Tuff or LaCrosse) are also an excellent choice of footwear for our fieldwork in the interior and north. Good rain gear (top and bottom, with taped seams) is also a necessity. An emergency poncho also takes up a small amount of space but can be a good layer in heavy rain.\n\n4.2.1 Tents\nEverybody will need a tent. Because we will not be able to pack up in the event of inclement weather, all tents should have a full rain fly. Many off the shelf tents do not come with a full rain fly, and instead have no rain fly or a partial rain fly.\n\n\n\nrain fly types\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Boots and Rain Gear\nThis is a field course and students will be expected to have the gear that will allow them to conduct field activities. Please review in detail the packing list below. Rubber boots and rain gear are two very key components of the field gear that you will need.\n\n4.2.2.1 Rubber Boots\nEnsure your rubber boots are calf or knee high (not ankle height) rubber boots. Two excellent brands are XtraTuf and LaCrosse - below are just some suggestions (of course you are free to bring any brand of rubber boots that you feel will also be adequate) - note that these suggestions are all boots that are at least 14-18” tall. You will want rubber boots that are in this height range.\n\nXtraTuf:\n\n15” men’s\n15” women’s\n\nLaCrosse\n\n18” Burly Mens\n14” Grange Women’s\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2.2 Rain Gear\nThere are many different types of rain gear ranging from heavy duty fishing style rain gear to shell-type thin rain gear - you should ensure that the rain gear you bring for this course is waterproof (not just water resistant) and has, at a minimum, taped inner seams. Many of the “semi-waterproof, semi-breathable” styles of light rain gear do NOT have taped inner seams. They will let water in in a heavy rain or in constant all day rain. In order to ensure your comfort throughout the course, please ensure you select rain gear that is well suited to all day rain conditions, which we may encounter. REI has a fairly comprehensive rain jacket selection guide. Nearly all fishing style rain gear (i.e. Helly Hansen, Grundens, Simms) will be waterproof and appropriate for the course, but many other types of rain gear will be just fine provided they are truly waterproof.\nPlease ensure you have both a waterproof wet weather top (i.e. rain jacket) AND waterproof wet weather bottoms. The bottoms could be rain pants or bibs (suspender style rain pants).\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Individual Packing List\nThis is a minimum packing list - you are free to bring anything else you feel that you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nQuantity\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nField Clothes\n\n\nUnderwear\n7 pairs (minimum)\n\n\n\nSocks\n7 pairs (minimum)\nIdeally crew length/longer.
