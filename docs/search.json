Fieldwork will begin gradually, gaining in complexity and intensity with movement north; especially north of Fairbanks. Throughout the course, we will be camping many nights with a few nights of “civilization” in Fairbanks that will let you rest a bit more comfortably, launder some clothes, and prepare for more time in the field. Once we leave Fairbanks, there will be very little in the way of provisions, so please come prepared with all needed gear. If you have ANY questions, kindly contact one of the instructors for guidance.",

Students must provide their own camp gear, be able to walk on uneven or rocky ground and be physically fit for field work.\nComprehension of the major factors governing the properties and behavior of soils, and the associated climate, hydrology and ecology on a transect between Anchorage and Deadhorse, AK is essential to understanding the soil classification and permafrost dynamics associated with environmental change.\nThe class is a mix of lectures, fieldworks, practical sessions, and special events. Hands-on activities include soil description and classification, vegetation characterization as well as coring and sampling of frozen soils.",
